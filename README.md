## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Parrot Optimizer (PO), an efficient optimization algorithm inspired by the behaviors of trained Pyrrhura Molinae parrots. The algorithm is introduced and detailed in the research paper titled "Parrot optimizer: Algorithm and applications to medical problems" by Junbo Lian, Guohua Hui, Ling Ma, Ting Zhu, Xincan Wu, Ali Asghar Heidari, Yi Chen, and Huiling Chen, published in Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2024.

## Abstract

Stochastic optimization methods have gained significant prominence as effective techniques in contemporary research, addressing complex optimization challenges efficiently. The Parrot Optimizer (PO) is introduced as an efficient optimization method, showcasing distinct characteristics in handling various optimization problems. The paper presents qualitative analysis and comprehensive experiments, benchmarking the PO on 35 functions, including classical cases and problems from the IEEE CEC 2022 test sets. Comparative analysis with eight popular algorithms highlights the competitive advantages of the PO, emphasizing its exploratory and exploitative traits. Parameter sensitivity experiments further explore the adaptability of the PO under varying configurations. The study extends the assessment to real-world applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PO in engineering design problems, disease diagnosis, and medical image segmentation. The results substantiate that the PO is a promising and competitive algorithm, surpassing some existing algorithms in the literature.

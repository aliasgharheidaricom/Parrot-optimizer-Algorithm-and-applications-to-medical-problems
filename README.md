## Introduction

Welcome to the Parrot Optimizer repository! The Parrot Optimizer (PO) is an innovative optimization algorithm inspired by the behaviors of trained Pyrrhura Molinae parrots. This repository contains the source code for the PO, along with comprehensive documentation to help you understand and utilize this powerful optimization tool.

## Overview

This repository houses the implementation of the PO algorithm, introduced and detailed in the research paper titled "Parrot optimizer: Algorithm and applications to medical problems." The paper, authored by Junbo Lian, Guohua Hui, Ling Ma, Ting Zhu, Xincan Wu, Ali Asghar Heidari, Yi Chen, and Huiling Chen, was published in Computers in Biology and Medicine in 2024.

## Key Features

- Efficient optimization inspired by parrot behaviors.
- Qualitative analysis and experiments on 35 functions.
- Benchmarking against popular algorithms.
- Adaptability demonstrated in engineering design, disease diagnosis, and medical image segmentation.
